# Emotion-Classification-with-LoRA-Fine-Tuning-Synthetic-Data-Generation

This project builds an emotion classification model by combining:

Synthetic data generation using an instruction-tuned LLM

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning of a transformer model

Evaluation using accuracy, macro-F1, and confusion matrix

The goal is to enrich the dataset with diverse synthetic samples and fine-tune a lightweight model for high performance.
